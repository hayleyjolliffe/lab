    <p>Welcome to the R&D lab, the digital home of my working environment.</p>

    <p>I value <a href="https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zCMhncA1iSE74MKKYQS5PBZ" target="_blank">working with the garage door up</a>, so context might be beneficial here.
    This site functions like a digital garden, and makes my working notes public. If a note doesn't make sense to you,
    it's because it wasn't written for you. Additionally, notes may appear incomplete. They likely are. That's part of the fun of experimenting in public ;)</p>

    <p>The bulk of my work is open-source and made possible through crowd-funding. Consider sponsoring future work through <a href="https://ko-fi.com/hayleyjolliffe" target="_blank">Ko-Fi</a> or <a href="https://github.com/hayleyjolliffe">GitHub</a>.</p>

    <p>&mdash; Hayley (<a href="mailto:hayleyjolliffe@proton.me">Email</a> / <a href="https://hayleyjolliffe.co" target="_blank">Main Site</a> / <a href="https://x.com/hayleyjolliffe" target="_blank">X</a>)</p>

    <p>PS: Navigation is still in development. For the time being, navigation is done through internal linking within notes. Thanks for being patient!</p>

    <p><small>This site was largely inspired by <a href="https://notes.andymatuschak.org" target="_blank">Andy Matuschak</a> and <a href="https://nesslabs.com" target="_blank">Anne-Laure Le Cunff</a>.</small></p>

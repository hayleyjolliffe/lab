# R&D @ Weston Labs

Welcome to R&D lab, the digital home of my working environment.

I value [working with the garage door up](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zCMhncA1iSE74MKKYQS5PBZ), so context might be beneficial here. The site functions like a digital garden, and makes my working notes public. If a note doesn't make sense to you, it's because it wasn't written for you. Additionally, notes may appear incomplete. They likely are. That's part of the fun of experimenting in public ;)

The bulk of my work is open-source and made possible through crowd-funding. Consider sponsoring future work through [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/hayleyjolliffe).

PS: Navigation is stil in development. For the time being, navigation is done through internal linking within notes. Thanks for being patient!

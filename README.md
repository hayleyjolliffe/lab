# R&D @ Weston Labs

The R&D Lab site is a public-facing extension of my research environment. Largely inspired by [Andy Matuschak](https://notes.andymatuschak.org), [Caleb Porzio](https://calebporzio.com), and [Anne-Laure Le Cunff](https://nesslabs.com), the site is built with Jekyll and connected to my Obsidian workspace It creates a workflow for moving notes, experiments, and insights from private exploration to public documentation.

Key features in this release:

- Scalable workflow for self-directed research and experimentation
- Obsidian + Jekyll integration for low-friction publishing
- Knowledge linking + automation to surface patterns and insights
- Lightweight design focused on clarity and long-term maintainability

The project is still in the early stages, but I value [working with the garage door up](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zCMhncA1iSE74MKKYQS5PBZ), so the goal is simple: build an open, evolving system for learning, documenting, and experimenting in public.
